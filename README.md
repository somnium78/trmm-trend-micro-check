üîß Troubleshooting
Common Issues

No Data in Reports:

    Verify custom field name matches exactly: trend_micro_status
    Ensure Collector Task has executed successfully
    Check script execution logs in TRMM
    Confirm agents have proper permissions

Script Execution Errors:

    Verify PowerShell execution policy allows script execution
    Check Windows version compatibility
    Review TRMM agent logs for detailed error messages
    Ensure administrative privileges for registry access

Installation Detection Issues:

    Script checks both 32-bit and 64-bit installation paths
    Registry access requires appropriate permissions
    Some Trend Micro versions may use different registry locations
    German Windows localization handled automatically

Report Template Issues:

    Verify VARIABLES section matches trend_micro_data_query.json
    Ensure client filter is properly configured
    Check Jinja2 template syntax for any modifications

Debug Mode

Execute the script with -Debug parameter for detailed logging:

.\Win_TrendMicro_WFBS_Status_Check.ps1 -Debug

This provides verbose output including:

    Installation path detection
    Service status details
    Registry access attempts
    Signature date parsing
    Final health status calculation

Registry Locations

The script checks multiple registry paths for maximum compatibility:

Version Information:

    HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\TrendMicro\PC-cillinNTCorp\CurrentVersion
    HKLM:\SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\PC-cillinNTCorp\CurrentVersion

Real-time Protection:

    HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\TrendMicro\PC-cillinNTCorp\CurrentVersion\Real Time Scan Configuration
    HKLM:\SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\PC-cillinNTCorp\CurrentVersion\Real Time Scan Configuration

Signature Information:

    HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\TrendMicro\PC-cillinNTCorp\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings
    HKLM:\SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\PC-cillinNTCorp\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings

üìù Customization
Modifying Health Thresholds

Edit the health status logic in Win_TrendMicro_WFBS_Status_Check.ps1:

# Signature age threshold (default: 7 days)
if ($Status.signature_age -le 7) {
    # Considered current
}

Adding Custom Monitoring

Extend the script with additional checks:

# Add custom registry checks
$CustomReg = Get-ItemProperty -Path &quot;HKLM:\SOFTWARE\...&quot; -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Add to status object
$Status.custom_field = $CustomValue

Report Customization

Modify the report template to:

    Change color schemes
    Add additional columns
    Modify sorting logic
    Customize summary statistics
    Add company branding
